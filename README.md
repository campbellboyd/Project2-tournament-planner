# Project2-tournament-planner
Project 2 for Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Course

This repo contains the three files for running the Project:

tournament.py - the source code fo the engine
tournament_test.py  - supplied test code
tournament.sql - sql to set up tournament database

To set up the database (taken from tournments.sql):
SQL to create the database, tables and views for the full-stack web developer
Intro to Relational Databases Final Project (aka Project 2)
This should be run as \i tournament.sql from the psql command line from the folder 
containing the tournament files once tournament database has been created in postgresql.

The project was written to include more than one tournament for extra credit. It was subsequently discovered that
udacity did not have a mechanism for testing extra credit features.

The project was adapted to pass the basic version tests,  but without the extra features being completely removed.

To run the tests: python tournament_test.py
